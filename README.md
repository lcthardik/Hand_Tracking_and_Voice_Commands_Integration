# Voice-Controlled and Hand Tracking System

This project demonstrates a voice-controlled hand tracking system using Python. It enables users to control their computer's mouse cursor through hand gestures captured by a webcam and voice commands recognized through a microphone. It was previously made for a hackathon.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone (hand tracking module)
- PyAutoGUI
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/voice-hand-tracking.git

## Usage
1. Run `main.py`:
2. Activate voice command mode by saying "Voice command activated".
3. Give voice commands such as:
- "Brakes off" or "Breaks off": Releases the brakes.
- "Follow hand" or "Polo hand": Starts hand tracking mode.
- "Exit voice" or "Left": Exits voice command mode.
